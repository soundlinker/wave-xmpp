      <b>wave-xmpp@appspot.com</b> is a robot which allows you to subscribe to waves so that your receive notifications via XMPP when users modify them.
      <br>
      <br>
      You need to configure your XMPP client so that ...@wavesandbox.com can receive IM messages.
      <br>
      <br>
      Trillian, Google Talk and Pidgin are confirmed to work with this.
      <br>
      <br>
      Upon your first subscription you will receive an invitation, else you just have to add wave-xmpp@appspot.com to your contact list and not block it.
      <br>
      <br>
      <hr noshade size="1">
      <br>
      To use it, invite <b>wave-xmpp@appspot.com</b> as a participant to a wave. It will then insert a menu with two buttons. One for subscribing, one for unsubscribing.
      <br>
      <br>
      If there are no buttons in the wave, because they have been deleted, type <del>x:menu</del> <b>[xmpp_m]</b> into an empty blip.
      <br>
      <br>
      You can also type <del>x:sub</del> <b>[xmpp_s]</b> or <del>x:unsub</del> <b>[xmpp_u]</b> into an empty blip to subscribe or unsubscribe, respectively.
